					<h2>The Basic Stick </h2>
					<p>The Basic Stick is the perfect stick for beginners. The 
						stick rotates slowly to provide extra tme for performing
						stick tricks, but is flashy enough to impress your
						friends. Enjoy the following:
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<strong>Patented Dura-Coat</strong> finish ensures sticks can withstand all weather conditions. More 
							durable than other sticks, these props will keep looking like new for as long as you own 
							them.
						</p>

							<p>
							<strong>Enhanced stick flexibility</strong> provides more bounce, allowing for better tricks. A soft rubber 
							core adds a whole new element to the sticking experience that you have to feel to believe!
							</p>

							<p>
							<strong>Full customization</strong> will give you the chance to own a pair of sticks unlike any others out 
							there. I make exactly what you want, with your colors and your designs.
							</p>

							<p>
							<strong>A personal touch</strong> through both my customization options and hand-crafted designs.
							</p>
